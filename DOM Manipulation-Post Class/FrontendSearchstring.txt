                        <b>In June 2008, a Dutch woman </b>
                        <span>
                            named Astrid Joosten left the Netherlands with her husband for an
                            adventure vacation in Uganda. It wasn’t their first trip to Africa,
                            but it would be more consequential than the others.
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p id="test-para">
                        At home in Noord-Brabant, Joosten, 41, worked as a business analyst
                        for an electrical company. Both she and her spouse, a financial
                        manager, enjoyed escaping Europe on annual getaways. In 2002, they had
                        flown to Johannesburg and, stepping off the airplane, felt love for
                        Africa at first sight. On later trips they visited Mozambique, Zambia,
                        and Mali. The journey to Uganda in 2008, booked through an
                        adventure-travel outfitter, would allow them to see mountain gorillas
                        in the southwestern highlands of the country as well as some other
                        wildlife and cultures. They worked their way south toward Bwindi
                        Impenetrable Forest, where the gorillas reside. On one day, the
                        operators offered a side trip, an option, to a place called the
                        Maramagambo Forest, where the chief attraction was a site known as
                        Python Cave. African rock pythons lived there, languid and content,
                        grown large on a diet of bats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Joosten’s husband, later her widower, is a fair-skinned man named Jaap
                        Taal, a calm fellow with a shaved head and dark, roundish glasses.
                        Most of the other travelers didn’t fancy this Python Cave offering, he
                        told me later. “But Astrid and I always said, ‘Maybe you come here
                        only once in your life, and you have to do everything you can.’ ” They
                        rode to Maramagambo Forest and then walked a mile or so, gradually
                        ascending, to a small pond. Nearby, half-concealed by moss and other
                        greenery, like a crocodile’s eye barely surfaced, was a low, dark
                        opening. Joosten and Taal, with their guide and one other client,
                        climbed down into the cave.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The footing was bad: rocky, uneven, and slick. The smell was bad too:
                        fruity and sour. Think of a dreary barroom, closed and empty, with
                        beer on the floor at three a.m. The cave seemed to have been carved by
                        a creek, or at least to have channeled its waters, and part of the
                        overhead rock had collapsed, leaving a floor of boulders and coarse
                        rubble, a moonscape, coated with guano like a heavy layer of vanilla
                        icing. It served as a major roosting site for the Egyptian fruit bat
                        (Rousettus aegyptiacus), a crow-size chiropteran that’s widespread and
                        relatively abundant in Africa and the Middle East. The cave’s ceiling
                        was thick with them—many thousands, agitated and chittering at the
                        presence of human intruders, shifting position, some dropping free to
                        fly and then settling again. Joosten and Taal kept their heads low and
                        watched their step, trying not to slip, ready to put a hand down if
                        needed. “I think that’s how Astrid got infected,” Taal told me. “I
                        think she put her hand on a piece of rock, which contained droppings
                        of a bat, which are infected. And so she had it on her hand.” Maybe
                        she touched her face an hour later, or put a piece of candy in her
                        mouth, “and that’s how I think the infection got in her.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No one had warned Joosten and Taal about the potential hazards of an
                        African bat cave. They knew nothing of a virus called Marburg (though
                        they had heard of Ebola). They only stayed in the cave about 10
                        minutes. They saw a python, large and torpid. Then they left,
                        continued their Uganda vacation, visited the mountain gorillas, took a
                        boat trip, and flew back to Amsterdam. Thirteen days after the cave
                        visit, home in Noord-Brabant, Joosten fell sick.

                        No one had warned Joosten and Taal about the potential hazards of an
                        African bat cave.At first it seemed no worse than the flu. Then her
                        temperature climbed higher and higher. After a few days, she began
                        suffering organ failure. Her doctors, knowing of her recent time in
                        Africa, suspected Lassa virus or maybe Marburg. “Marburg,” said Taal,
                        “what’s that?” Joosten’s brother looked it up on Wikipedia and told
                        him: “Marburg virus: It kills, could be big trouble.” In fact, it’s a
                        filovirus, the closest relative to the ebolaviruses (of which there
                        are five species, including the most infamous, Ebola). Marburg was
                        first discovered in 1967, when a group of African monkeys, imported to
                        Marburg an der Lahn, in western Germany, for medical research uses,
                        passed a nasty new virus to laboratory workers. Five people died. In
                        the decades since, it has also struck hundreds of Africans, with a
                        case fatality rate of up to 90 percent.

                            Toronto, Hanoi, and Singapore, eventually to be known as SARS. These
                            cases and others, equally spooky, represent not isolated events but
                            a pattern, a trend: the emergence of new human diseases from
                            wildlife.

                        The experts call such diseases zoonoses, meaning animal infections
                        that spill into people. About 60 percent of human infectious diseases
                        are zoonoses. For the most part, they result from infection by one of
                        six types of pathogen: viruses, bacteria, fungi, protists, prions, and
                        worms. The most troublesome are viruses. They are abundant, adaptable,
                        not subject to antibiotics, and only sometimes deterred by antiviral
                        drugs. Within the viral category is one particularly worrisome
                        subgroup, RNA viruses. AIDS is caused by a zoonotic RNA virus. So was
                        the 1918 influenza, which killed 50 million people. Ebola is an RNA
                        virus, which emerged in Uganda this summer after four years of
                        relative quiescence. Marburg, Lassa, West Nile, Nipah, dengue, rabies,
                        yellow fever virus, and the SARS bug are too.

                        Over the last half dozen years, I have asked eminent disease
                        scientists and public-health officials, including some of the world’s
                        experts on Ebola, on SARS, on bat-borne viruses, on HIV-1 and HIV-2,
                        and on viral evolution, the same two-part question: 1) Will a new
                        disease emerge, in the near future, sufficiently virulent and
                        transmissible to cause a pandemic capable of killing tens of millions
                        of people? and 2) If so, what does it look like and from where does it
                        come? Their answers to the first part have ranged from maybe to
                        probably. Their answers to the second have focused on zoonoses,
                        particularly RNA viruses. The prospect of a new viral pandemic, for
                        these sober professionals, looms large. They talk about it; they think
                        about it; they make contingency plans against it: the Next Big One.
                        They say it might happen anytime.

                        To understand what killed Astrid Joosten, and to see her case within
                        the context of the Next Big One, you need to understand how viruses
                        evolve. Edward C. Holmes is one of the world’s leading experts in
                        viral evolution. He sits in a bare office at the Center for Infectious
                        Disease Dynamics, which is part of Pennsylvania State University, and
                        discerns patterns of viral change by scrutinizing sequences of genetic
                        code. That is, he looks at long runs of the five letters (A, C, T, G,
                        and U) that represent nucleotide bases in a DNA or RNA molecule,
                        strung out in unpronounceable streaks as though typed by a manic
                        chimpanzee. Holmes’s office is tidy and comfortable, furnished with a
                        desk, a table, and several chairs. There are few bookshelves, few
                        books, few files or papers. A thinker’s room. On the desk is a
                        computer with a large monitor. That’s how it all looked when I
                        visited, anyway.

                        Above the computer was a poster celebrating “the Virosphere,” meaning
                        the totality of viral diversity on Earth. Beside that was another
                        poster, showing Homer Simpson as a character in Edward Hopper’s famous
                        painting “Nighthawks.” Homer is seated at the diner counter with a
                        plate of doughnuts before him.

                        Holmes is an Englishman, transplanted to central Pennsylvania from
                        London and Cambridge. His eyes bug out slightly when he discusses a
                        crucial fact or an edgy idea, because good facts and ideas impassion
                        him. His head is round and, where not already bald, shaved austerely.
                        He wears wiry glasses with a thick metal brow, and while he looks a
                        bit severe, Holmes is anything but. He’s lively and humorous, a
                        generous soul who loves conversation about what matters: viruses.
                        Everyone calls him Eddie.

                    <p>
                        During the early 20th century, disease scientists from the Rockefeller
                        Foundation and other institutions conceived the ambitious goal of
                        eradicating some infectious diseases entirely. They tried hard with
                        yellow fever, spending millions of dollars and many years of effort,
                        and failed. They tried with malaria and failed. They tried later with
                        smallpox and succeeded. Why? The differences among those three
                        diseases are many and complex, but probably the most crucial one is
                        that smallpox resided neither in a reservoir host nor in a vector,
                        such as a mosquito or tick. Its ecology was simple. It existed in
                        humans—in humans only—and was therefore much easier to eradicate. The
                        campaign to eradicate polio, begun in 1998 by WHO and other
                        institutions, is a realistic effort for the same reason: Polio isn’t
                        zoonotic. Eradicating a zoonotic disease, whether a directly
                        transmitted one like Ebola or an insect-vectored one such as yellow
                        fever, is much more complicated. Do you exterminate the pathogen by
                        exterminating the species of bat or primate or mosquito in which it
                        resides? Not easily, you don’t, and not without raising an outcry. The
                        notion of eradicating chimpanzees as a step toward preventing the
                        future spillover of another HIV would provoke a deep and bitter
                        discussion, to put it mildly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s the salubrious thing about zoonotic diseases: They remind us,
                        as St. Francis did, that we humans are inseparable from the natural
                        world. In fact, there is no “natural world,” it’s a bad and artificial
                        phrase. There is only the world. Humankind is part of that world, as
                        are the ebolaviruses, as are the influenzas and the HIVs, as are
                        Marburg and Nipah and SARS, as are chimpanzees and palm civets and
                        Egyptian fruit bats, as is the next murderous virus—the one we haven’t
                        yet detected. And while humans don’t evolve nearly as fast and as
                        variously as an RNA virus does, we may—let me repeat that word, may—be
